# What are IOPS â€” 

Input/Output Operations Per Seconds:  
it's pretty useful to measure at ranfom workloads

In the above image,  
we 've random read capacity of <= 500k IOPS
we 've random write capacity of <= 480k IOPS

In the above image:  
Block-Size & Concurrency depend on Software,  
Throughput & Latency are deteremined by Hardware,

**Usecase/Trade-Offs** -  

- High Random IOPS are good for RDBMS like Oracle/MySQL etc,  
because reading a row/record from table/views is random  
- High Sequential IOPS are good for DataWarehouses,  
as they generally work on a batch of rows
