# Bloom Filter - 

A `Bloom Filter` is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure,  
that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set.  
`False Positive` matches are possible, but `False Negatives` are not  
â€“ in other words, a query returns either "**possibly in set**" or "**definitely not in set**".
