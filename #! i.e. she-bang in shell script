Shell-Script usually begins with one of the following typical line:

- #!/bin/bash - Execute the file using the `Bash shell`
- #!/bin/ksh - Execute the file using the `Korn shell`
- #!/bin/sh - Execute the file using the `Bourne shell`, or a compatible shell, assumed to be in the /bin directory
- #!/usr/bin/env bash - Execute the file using the `Bash shell`
- #!/usr/bin/env sh - Execute the file using the `Bourne shell`, or a compatible shell, assumed to be in the /bin directory
- #!/usr/bin/env python - Execute with a `Python interpreter`, using the env program search path to find it
- #!/usr/bin/pwsh - Execute the file using `PowerShell`
- #!/bin/false - `Do nothing, but return a non-zero exit status, indicating failure`. 
    Used to prevent stand-alone execution of a script file intended for execution in a specific context, 
      such as by the `.` command from sh/bash, `source` from csh/tcsh, or as a .profile, .cshrc, or .login file

This first line (#!/bin/bash or #!/bin/sh) has a name. 
It is known as 'she-bang'(shabang) or also sometimes called as 'hashbang' or 'Interpreter Directive'
