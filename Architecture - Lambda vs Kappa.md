# Data Proecessing Architecture – 

There're 2 types of data-processing architecture as follows:  

# Lambda –

# Kappa –

**Difference:**  
Lambda supports both batch & real-time data processing, whereas  
Kappa supports only real-time processing

**Near**-real-time is more meaningful and useful then real-time  
we can not really do anything with real-time data, because to apply aggregate or perform analysis, we need bunch of data points,  
hence, near-real-time is more useful for data analysis
