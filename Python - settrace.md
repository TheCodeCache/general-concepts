There are two ways to inject code to watch a program run: tracing and profiling.   
  They are similar, but intended for different purposes and so have different constraints.   
  The easiest, but least efficient, way to monitor a program is through a trace hook,   
  which can be used for writing a debugger, code coverage monitoring, or many other purposes.  
    
The trace hook is modified by passing a callback function to sys.settrace().   
The callback will receive three arguments:  
  frame (the stack frame from the code being run),   
  event (a string naming the type of notification),   
  arg (an event-specific value).   
There are 7 event types for different levels of information that occur as a program is being executed.  
  
Event         When                                arg_value  
'call'        Before a function is executed.      None  
'line'        Before a line is executed.          None  
'return'      Before a function returns.          The value being returned.  
'exception'   After an exception occurs.          The (exception, value, traceback) tuple.  
'c_call'      Before a C function is called.      The C function object.  
'c_return'    After a C function returns.         None  
'c_exception' After a C function throws an error. None
